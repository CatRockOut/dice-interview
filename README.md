# ðŸŽ² Dice Game - Next.js App

This is a Dice Game web application built with **TypeScript**, **Next.js** and **Material UI**.

## Description

The game allows users to test their luck by predicting whether a randomly generated number (between 1 and 100) will be **greater** or **less** than a user-defined threshold.

## Features

- Users can input a number as a threshold.
- Users can choose between "Under" or "Over" to set the win condition.
- On clicking "Play", the app generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- The app compares the generated number with the threshold and displays a message or icon indicating whether the user won or lost.
- Each result is recorded and displayed in a game history list.
- The history stores up to 10 of the most recent results.

## Tech Stack
